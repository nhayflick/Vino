Vino allows users to search for Vine video clips by keyword and watch the results in a fluid, streaming playlist. Check
it out for yourself on Heroku: http://vinosearch.heroku.com/

It uses the Twitter Search API and YQL proxying to find and extract Vines, a Backbone.js frontend to display results
and custom jQuery/JavaScript to autoplay and scroll between vines. It is currently optimized for any HTML5 Video-compatible
browser.
